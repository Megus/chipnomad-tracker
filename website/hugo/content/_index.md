**ChipNomad** is a chiptune tracker for handheld consoles like Anbernic RG35xx and others.
It is heavily inspired by [LSDJ](https://www.littlesounddj.com) and [Dirtywave M8 tracker](https://dirtywave.com).

ChipNomad currently lets you make music for AY-3-8910/YM2149F chips with more chips
coming in the future. It is under development now with fully functional alpha versions available
for download.
