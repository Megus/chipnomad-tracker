# Chain Screen

![](chain.png)

A chain is a sequence of phrases. You can have up to 16 phrases in a chain and use the same phrase many times. The second column is the transpose value in semitones.

If the chain is used in the project multiple times, then there will be an asterisk (**\***) character next to its number.
